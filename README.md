# Prescriptive-Analytics-Supply-Chain-Management

## Task: 
The dataset describes the process to manufacture two products. Both the products go through three steps: Shaping, Painting and Firing shops. The number of labours required to complete one piece of each product is mentioned in the table. The allowable working hours of labours is the constraint.

The task is to optimize the number of parts manufactured of each category to maximize the profits. 

## Solution: This is the prescriptive type of Analytics. We can use Solver Excel Addin to solve such type of problem
